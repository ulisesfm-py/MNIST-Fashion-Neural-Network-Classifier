# MNIST Fashion Neural Network Classifier

This project implements a neural network from scratch to classify grayscale images of clothing from the MNIST dataset. 
Data folder is not added because of storage limits in github. The dataset can be obtain from: \href{https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist}{Zalando Github Link}
Data folder contains:
* images_train.csv
* images_test.csv
* labels_train.csv
* labels_test.csv

## Overview
The neural network is built using NumPy and includes:

* Forward and backward propagation
* Gradient descent optimization
* Regularization to prevent overfitting
* Visualization of training and validation loss and accuracy

## Features
* Implements a simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer
* Supports regularization to improve generalization
* Plots loss and accuracy over epochs for training and validation sets

## Dependencies
Python 3.x
NumPy
Matplotlib
